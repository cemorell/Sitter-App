# Sitter Now


Sitter Now is an app for parents needing a last minute or steady babysitter. Targeting parents in new cities or in need of a new sitter and babysitters looking for jobs, this app tries to bridge the connection between the two demographics.  Users are able to log into a unique account, access and edit their profile information then navigate to an all-sitters page where they can filter sitter results then email the sitter.


## Technologies Used
  * Express, Node.js
  * HTML/CSS
  * React
  * Bootstrap/Font Awesome
  * Auth0
  * mongoDB
  

## Approach Taken
  * The pre-code and first days were primarly used to wirefram, user story and ERD different scales to the site and the beginnings of starting to code.
  * The second day was spent setting up DB connections, Auth0, and setting up the backend of the app and Navigation.
  * The 3rd day was for adding editing features and starting the filter features.
  * The 4th day was for finishing the filter feature, styling with CSS, deploying and trying to add bonus features. 

## Unsolved Problems
  *Well there were quite a few. Ideally, matching would be a feature that would require authentication and in hindsight, setting the user as a sitter or parent would be permanent but with a bit more time I think I could solve a healthy amount of these problems.
